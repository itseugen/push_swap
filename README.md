# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

## The push_swap operations:
- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- ss: sa and sb at the same time.
- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time

## The sorting:
<p>
	For this project I use a own version of the Mergesort alghorithm. I cut the stack into multiple smaller chunks which I then push to stack B after another. I then push the largest element back to A before pushing everything back to A. Before printing out my operations I clean redundant operations (p. e. "rra" and "ra" afterwards).

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/itseugen/push_swap
```
2. Enter the directory and build the library:
```shell
cd push_swap
make
```
Optional: Open the visualiser (not by me, CMake necessary):
```shell
make vis
```
